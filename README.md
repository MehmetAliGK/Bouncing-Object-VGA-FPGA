# VGA Bouncing Object (VHDL Project)
This project demonstrates a single object bouncing on a VGA screen using VHDL. The object starts at the center and moves in a random direction, bouncing off screen edges.

## Features
- Random Color: The object appears in a random color.
- Adjustable Speed: The movement speed can be modified.
- Simple Shape: The object is represented as a rectangle.

## Requirements
- FPGA Board: Xilinx Spartan 3E Starter Board.
- Development Tools: VHDL synthesis tools (e.g., Xilinx ISE or Vivado).

## How to Use
1. Load the VHDL files into your FPGA development environment.
2. Synthesize and program the design onto your FPGA.
3. Connect a VGA monitor to the FPGA and observe the object.
4. Adjust the object speed using button that specified.

## Future Improvements
- Add multiple objects.
- Introduce different shapes.
- Implement object-object collision physics.

## Contributions
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the project.
